                        <p>Issuer default risk<br>&nbsp; <br>In the event that a structured product issuer becomes insolvent and defaults on their listed securities, investors will be considered as unsecured creditors and will have no preferential claims
                            to any assets held by the issuer.&nbsp; Investors should therefore pay close attention to the financial strength and credit worthiness of structured product issuers.&nbsp; </p>
